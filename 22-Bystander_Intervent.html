						<p>
							Everyone can take an <b style="color: #FCE011">active role</b> in preventing sexual violence, stalking and dating/partner violence by making the choice to intervene. If you see a situation that might lead to sexual violence, hear a sexist comment or joke, or are worried for someone’s safety: <b style="color: #FCE011">speak up, it’s our place!</b> Your actions could stop violent behavior before it starts. Bystander intervention does not have to be confrontational. There is no one way to be an active bystander. Intervene in a way that feels right to you and in a way that will keep you safe.

								Some of the options you have to intervene include direct, delegate, or distract:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b style="color: #FCE011">Direct</b> – you are directly interacting with the potential perpetrator or victim and addressing the concern.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b style="color: #FCE011">Delegate</b> – asking or telling someone else what to do to help address the concern (i.e. friend, bartender, other bystanders, police).
								</li>
								<li>
									<b style="color: #FCE011">Distract</b> – this is the art of <b style="color: #FCE011">diversion</b>: you attempt to pull the attention of the people involved away from the situation.
