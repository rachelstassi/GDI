					<p style="margin: 0 7.5% 2.5% 7.5%">
						You’re out at a bar when you notice a woman on the dancefloor. She’s happily dancing to the music all by herself. A man approaches and begins dancing up on her, touching her hips and lower back as they dance. Her facial expression and body language tell you she is uncomfortable. She tries to get some distance from the man, but he continues to follow her.

						<h3 style="color: #FCE011; display: inline; font-family: 'Lubalin Graph Medium'; font-style:  italic">
							<span style="border-color: #FFF">Direct</span>
						</h3>
						<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 5%">
							You are <b style="color: #FCE011">directly interacting</b> with the potential perpetrator or <b style="color: #FCE011">targeted person</b> and addressing the concern.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 2.5%">
							For example:
						</p>
						<ul style="margin-left: 5%">
							<li>
								Say to both people, “She seemed to be doing just fine by herself.”
							</li>
							<li>
								Or to say to the person dancing, “Are you feeling alright? Would you like to sit down and have a glass of water?”
							</li>
							<li>
								Or to say to the person you think may cause harm, “Hey, you can’t touch people without asking them first.”
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="delegate">
						<h3 style="color: #FCE011; display: inline; font-family: 'Lubalin Graph Medium'; font-style:  italic">
							<span style="border-color: #FFF">Delegate</span>
						</h3>
						<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 5%">
							You <b style="color: #FCE011">ask or tell</b> someone else what to do to help address the concern (i.e. friend, bartender, other bystanders, emergency services).
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 2.5%">
							For example:
						</p>
						<ul style="margin-left: 5%">
							<li>
								Talk to your friends: “I am concerned for that person. Can you find her friends and get them to check on the situation, while I stay here and watch?”
							</li>
							<li>
								Ask a bouncer, staff, or other employee to look into the situation. For example, “I am worried for that woman, who looks uncomfortable with that person. Can you help me see if she is okay?”
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="distract">
						<h3 style="color: #FCE011; display: inline; font-family: 'Lubalin Graph Medium'; font-style:  italic">
							<span style="border-color: #FFF">Distract</span>
						</h3>
						<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 5%">
							You attempt to <b style="color: #FCE011">pull the attention</b> of the people involved away from the situation.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 2.5%">
							For example:
						</p>
						<ul style="margin-left: 5%">
							<li>
								Ask the women dancing to help you find a lost item, interrupt to ask for directions, spill a drink, or start talking to the two dancing and don’t leave the two people alone together. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Invite the targeted person to go to the bathroom or outside with you. Once the person is away from the person who may cause harm, check in and ask if the targeted person is afraid or needs help.
							</li>
							<li>
								Walk up to them and ask, “Do I know you?” She might play along and reply, “Oh yes aren’t you in my biology class? I have been meaning to call you.” and the other man might leave.
							</li>
