								In addition to the federal Title IX law, PSU has internal policies that address your safety and they are:
							</p>
							<p class="hanging"> 
								PSU <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/dos/psu-student-code-conduct#SexualAssault">Student Code of Conduct</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								The Student Conduct Code describes the rights and responsibilities of all PSU students and student organizations.  The Student Conduct Code addresses issues of sexual misconduct (including <b style="color: #FCE011">sexual exploitation</b>, non-consensual sexual contact, and non consensual sexual intercourse), <b style="color: #FCE011">sexual harassment</b>, <b style="color: #FCE011">stalking</b> and <b style="color: #FCE011">dating or domestic violence</b>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/dos/">The Office of the Dean of Student Life</a> administers the Student Code of Conduct.

								PSU's <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/ogc/sites/www.pdx.edu.ogc/files/Policy_on_Prohibited_Discrimination_and_Harassment.Final_.pdf">Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment Policy</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								The Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment Policy addresses issues of sex/gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and discrimination/harassment based on any protected class. Other protected classes include, but are not limited to, age, disability, national origin, race, color, marital status, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic information, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you experience sexual assault or harassment at any time, you can get help from a confidential <b style="color: #FCE011">Advocate</b> at the Women’s Resource Center, Queer Resource Center or Pan African Commons. 
								Advocates help students of all genders identify which services will work best for them. To be connected with a confidential advocate, please call 503-725-5672 or schedule an appointment <a href="psuwrc.youcanbook.me">here</a>.
