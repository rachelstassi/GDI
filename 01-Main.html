								Even if you are not directly affected by discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual assault, chances are you know someone who will be or has been. It’s important that everyone learns about these issues. So you can know what conduct is prohibited and supported by PSU’s campus community to create a safer campus for everyone. The training is not meant to reflect on any individual, group or organization.

								The training includes both information and sample situations and will test you on your understanding of the material as you work through the training and questions from the examples. You must answer correctly before you can move on. At the end, you will be asked if you completed the training and to obtain credit, you will need to answer yes. You may not skip pages to complete the training but you can always pause and return to where you left.
